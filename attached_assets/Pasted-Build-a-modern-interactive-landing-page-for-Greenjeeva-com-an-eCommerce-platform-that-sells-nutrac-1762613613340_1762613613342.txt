Build a modern, interactive landing page for Greenjeeva.com, an eCommerce platform that sells nutraceutical products.
The goal of this page is to showcase competitor price trends for our products — both individual product price history and overall pricing insights across all products.

Please design a professional, data-driven dashboard-style landing page inspired by the visual feel of Rawbids.com.
Use clean UI, soft green tones (#3CB371) to align with Greenjeeva’s branding, and add charts, animations, and filters for an engaging user experience.

🔍 Page Sections & Features
1️⃣ Hero Section – Price Trends Overview

Add a banner titled “Compare Market Prices & Track Trends”.

Show a summary chart (line or area chart) showing average price trend across all products over time (e.g., weekly or monthly).

Display key insights like:

“Average Market Price Change (Last 4 Weeks)”

“Top 5 Products with Highest Price Drop”

“Top 5 Products with Highest Price Increase”

2️⃣ Product-Wise Price Trend Section

For each product (e.g., “Ashwagandha Extract”, “Pea Protein”, “Curcumin 95%”), show:

Product image

Product name, SKU, and short description

A line or bar chart comparing competitor prices vs. Greenjeeva price over the past 4–8 weeks

A small toggle or dropdown to switch between “Competitor A”, “Competitor B”, “Average Market Price”, etc.

A hover tooltip showing exact price and date on the chart

“Price Position” indicator → e.g., “You are 12% below average market price”

3️⃣ Interactive Comparison Dashboard (Optional Section)

Add a filter/search bar for customers to search for a product name or category (e.g., Protein, Herbal Extract, Vitamins).

Show a grid view of products with:

Product image

Last updated price

Weekly % change (colored green for drop, red for increase)

Button: “View Price Trend” → scrolls down to the detailed chart for that product.

4️⃣ Market Insights / Analytics Section

Include:

“Total Products Monitored”

“Competitors Tracked”

“Weekly Updates Completed”

“Next Update: {next scheduled date}”

A small interactive world map or region map showing price variance by region (optional advanced feature).

5️⃣ Footer

Add quick links to Greenjeeva.com, “About Us”, “Contact”, “Sourcing”, and “Transparency Policy”.

Include the tagline: “Empowering Buyers with Transparent Market Insights.”

🎨 Design Guidelines

Use React + TailwindCSS (or modern UI library).

Use charting libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for visualizations.

Keep the layout clean, modern, and responsive (mobile-friendly).

Add soft animations using Framer Motion for transitions.

Follow data transparency aesthetics (like TradingView, Rawbids, or CoinMarketCap).

🧩 Data Assumptions

You can assume the backend provides JSON data in this format:

{
  "product_name": "Ashwagandha Extract",
  "greenjeeva_price": [120, 118, 115, 119],
  "competitors": {
    "Competitor A": [130, 128, 125, 123],
    "Competitor B": [128, 127, 124, 120]
  },
  "dates": ["2025-10-01", "2025-10-08", "2025-10-15", "2025-10-22"]
}


Use this sample structure to populate mock charts and tables.

✅ Goal

To build a visually rich, interactive landing page that:

Shows individual product price trends compared to competitors

Displays aggregate pricing trends across all products

Encourages customer trust and transparency through data visualization
